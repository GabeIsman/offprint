Offprint is built on top of the Slim PHP framework and uses Backbone.js on the front. Offprint requires access to your "likes" and your friend\'s "likes." Your data, however, is yours (and Facebook\'s); I have no interest in it, and I am not going to clutter my server with it. If you\'re curious about me, I advise heading to my <a href="http://oberliner.net">home page</a>.'
